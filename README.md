# elixir-docker-template

this repository is built for people who just want to have the elixir as a process container and use all the functions without installing anything but docker to the host machine environment. The docker image is already connected to the host folder, so any script you write can be easily ran without rebuilding the image or anything.

## Setup 

Clone this repo, install docker, run this on the bash of the host enviroment that docker is running

### `docker-compose up`

# Important Notice

This image also has a built in bash on top of the elixir-alpine. This helps us to have the ability of going through our files inside the container and run any script easily inside the elixir environment while also benefitting from the lightweight release of the elixir-alpine. 

Full release is 1 GB and this way, we only run the environment with a setup of 90 MBs by only having the things we really we need to be able to run exs files. We can also add more stuff whenever needed.



## Good To Know

### `./docker run -it --rm ead_elixir bash`

Use this to open the bash of the elixir container.

### `./elixir your-script-name.exs`

Once in bash of the container, you can easily run the exs files by going into the folder where the exs file is and just run the command above with your exs file being the argument for the elixir command.

### `./docker run -it --rm ead_elixir`

Use this to run a new iex session.
